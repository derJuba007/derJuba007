### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Now here could be a text describing more about me and my projects. Maybe it would even reveal more about my knowledge and experience.
But that is not the case, consequently reading this text is also just a waste of time. But you don't stop reading, for whatever reason....

Alright in a nutshell: A guy from the north of Germany. Married to a wonderful woman. Loves web design and gaming. By day an electrician and test engineer - by night some kind of developer.
